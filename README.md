## What is fastQDA?
The aim of this project is to create an open-source alternative to the market leader MaxQDA. Written in C++ and Qt it is possible to use fastQDA on almost every plattform from mobile to desktop.

FastQDA is a 3-pane window which enables the user to interact freely with his code- and document-database and his active document in the center of the application. Each code can be colorized and represents the markercolor for the documents.

Each code consits of a name, a definition, an example (called the anchor), its representing color and its headcode. The code is identified with its unique name. Each settings is adjustable via the 'settings-dialog'.

With the usage of Qt it is possible to create an user-experience that matches the operating-systems style. It is not needed to have a special design for every plattform because everything is already provided by the Qt-framework.

## Usage notes:
At the time of writing the developement is made under Mac OS X with Sublime Text 3 and QtCreator for debugging-purpose. The backend for text-coding is made with the xpdf-toolchain which is freely available.

## Dependencies:

Up to now you need to have at least following programs installed:

- `xpdf`
